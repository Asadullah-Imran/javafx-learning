# JavaFX Learning Repository

Welcome to the JavaFX Learning Repository! This repository is designed to help you learn JavaFX, a powerful framework for building rich client applications using Java.

## What is JavaFX?

JavaFX is a set of Java graphics libraries for creating rich internet applications (RIAs). It provides a platform-independent API to build desktop, mobile, and web applications. JavaFX is known for its powerful features such as high-performance graphics rendering, animation support, multimedia playback, and more.

## Getting Started

To start learning JavaFX, follow these steps:

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have the latest version of JDK installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

2. **Download JavaFx:** Download JavaFX. You can download it from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/). store the file in a convenient place because we will need it every time we create a new project.

3. **Set Up Your IDE:** Choose your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development. Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans. Configure your IDE to work with JavaFX. Refer to the documentation of your IDE for instructions. (NB: I am using Inteliji IDEA). Here is a video guideline how you can setup your JavaFX on Inteliji IDEA [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udigo_qSp_k&t=157s) 

4. **Clone this Repository:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine. You can use the following command if you have Git installed:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Asadullah-Imran/javafx-learning.git
    ```

4. **Explore the Examples:** This repository contains various examples and projects to help you understand different aspects of JavaFX. Start with the basic examples and gradually move on to more advanced topics.

5. **Experiment and Modify:** Don't hesitate to experiment with the code. Modify the examples, tweak the parameters, and observe the changes. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of JavaFX.

6. **Join the Community:** Join online forums, discussion groups, or communities dedicated to JavaFX. Participate in discussions, ask questions, and share your experiences with fellow learners.
